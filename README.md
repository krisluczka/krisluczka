## Small showcase of the big projects
At the time I am working on a few projects - main goals of them are to learn how do specific things work.
To understand why some solutions have been used, you need to encounter the same problems as the developers
I feel that sometimes you need to reinvent the wheel and that is my motivation to develop these.
